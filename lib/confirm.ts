// Human-in-the-loop gate for git-me write tools.
//
// The agent drafts the text (commit message, PR body, review comment); this
// gate lets a human SEE it (and EDIT it) before anything reaches git, gh, or
// the PR review. Two paths:
//
//   editableText set       -> editor(): review + edit + accept/cancel
//   otherwise              -> confirm(): yes/no on a readable summary
//
// Prose tools (commit message, PR description, review comment) use the editable
// path because that is where models over-explain or misjudge tone. A forced
// path (`requireInteractive`) skips the flag and demands a yes/no regardless,
// and blocks headless mode entirely.
//
// PERSISTENCE: pi's extension flags (pi.registerFlag) are in-memory only, seeded
// from `default` and CLI `--flag-name` args at process start. There is no
// setFlag on ExtensionAPI and `pi config set <flag>` does NOT touch flags. So
// we own a tiny settings file at <piDir>/pi-git-me.json
// ({ confirmWrite: bool, allowHeadlessWrite: bool }), hydrate from it on read,
// and write through on toggle. `piDir` =
// process.env.PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR || ~/.pi/agent.
//
// The gate takes no ExtensionAPI on purpose: it never calls pi.getFlag (flags
// are in-memory only), so closing over `pi` would be dead weight. All write
// tools therefore stay flat consts (no factory), which keeps the tool set
// uniform with the read tools.
