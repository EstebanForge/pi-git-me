// Tool titles, descriptions, and per-parameter descriptions.
//
// Every write-tool description leads with the canonical rule: this tool is
// the only sanctioned path for posting text as the user, and it drives `gh`
// (the GitHub CLI) for GitHub. The pi agent reads these strings to decide
// WHEN to reach for each tool; the lead sentence makes the WHY unmistakable
// so the agent does not fall back to writing the text to a file and shelling
// out to gh itself (which would bypass the editable preview).
//
// SCOPE: this extension drives `git` and `gh` only. GitHub is the supported
// provider. Other providers — GitLab (glab), Gitea / Forgejo (tea),
// Bitbucket, direct REST / GraphQL access, MCP servers — are explicitly out
// of scope; the user wires those up themselves via whatever path they
// prefer (their own CLI, an MCP server, a script via the bash tool, etc.).
// Tool descriptions therefore say "GitHub" (or "the gh CLI"), not
// "any git provider".

// ============================================================== shared =====
// Optional on every tool. Defaults to the agent current directory (ctx.cwd).
// Lets the agent point a tool at a different repository than the one pi was
// started in (a sibling repo, a subdir, a monorepo member).
export const CWD_DESCRIPTION =
  "Working directory to run git or gh in. Defaults to the agent current directory. Set this to operate on a different repository than the one pi was started in. Should be inside a git working tree: write tools reject a path that is not one, read tools return an empty result.";

// ============================================================== read tools ==
// Read tools are not gated and do not post anything. They exist so the agent
// can ground its write-tool drafts in real diff / log / branch / PR state.

// -------------------------------------------------- git status -------------

export const GIT_STATUS_TITLE = "git: Status";

export const GIT_STATUS_DESCRIPTION = `PREFER THIS over running \`git status\` in the shell. Returns git working-tree + branch status for the current repository (\`git status --branch --porcelain\`): what is staged, unstaged, untracked, or in conflict, plus the current branch and its upstream tracking. Output is capped so a noisy working tree does not blow the context window — the raw shell command is not.`;

export const GIT_STATUS_MAX_LINES_DESCRIPTION =
  "Cap on the number of status lines returned. Default 200.";

// -------------------------------------------------- git diff ---------------

export const GIT_DIFF_TITLE = "git: Diff";

export const GIT_DIFF_DESCRIPTION = `PREFER THIS over running \`git diff\` in the shell. Returns a diff for the requested target — use it to inspect what a commit or PR description will describe. Targets: "staged" (HEAD vs index), "unstaged" (working tree vs index, default), "all" (staged + unstaged), or "branch" (working tree vs origin/<base>). Includes the full --stat summary plus the patch (truncated beyond 50 KB; the raw shell command is not capped).`;

export const GIT_DIFF_TARGET_DESCRIPTION =
  'Which diff to return. One of "staged", "unstaged" (default), "all", or "branch".';

export const GIT_DIFF_BASE_DESCRIPTION =
  'Base branch for target="branch". Default "main". Ignored for other targets.';

export const GIT_DIFF_MAX_BYTES_DESCRIPTION =
  "Patch byte cap. Default 50000. The full --stat is always returned.";

// -------------------------------------------------- git log ----------------

export const GIT_LOG_TITLE = "git: Log";

export const GIT_LOG_DESCRIPTION = `PREFER THIS over running \`git log\` in the shell. Returns the most recent commits on the current branch as a structured list (hash, ISO date, author, subject, body). Use this when a commit or PR description should reference prior history or follow the project's commit-message style. Capped at 100 entries (default 10); the raw shell command is not capped.`;

export const GIT_LOG_LIMIT_DESCRIPTION =
  "Number of commits to return (1-100). Default 10.";

// -------------------------------------------------- git current branch -----

export const GIT_CURRENT_BRANCH_TITLE = "git: Current Branch";

export const GIT_CURRENT_BRANCH_DESCRIPTION = `PREFER THIS over running \`git branch\` or \`git rev-parse\` in the shell. Returns the current branch name, or "HEAD (detached at <sha>)" when on a detached HEAD. Use this when you need to know which branch you are on before committing, opening a PR, or looking up the PR for the branch. Reads only; no write.`;

// -------------------------------------------------- git pr info ------------

export const GIT_PR_INFO_TITLE = "git: PR Info (GitHub via gh)";

export const GIT_PR_INFO_DESCRIPTION = `Return the GitHub pull request for the current branch via the \`gh\` CLI (\`gh pr view\`). Returns null when the branch has no PR or \`gh\` is not authenticated. Includes number, title, body, state, URL, base/head refs, draft flag, author, and review decision. Use this before drafting or updating a PR description so the suggestion is grounded in the existing PR (not the local diff alone).

Scope: this tool reads from \`gh\` and therefore covers GitHub only. For other providers (GitLab, Gitea / Forgejo, Bitbucket, etc.) use whatever tool the user has wired up — this extension does not cover them.`;

// ========================================================== write tools ====
// Every write tool description below leads with the canonical rule: USE THIS
// for any text that will be posted as the user. The tool drives `gh` (or
// `git` for the commit-message tool) and is the only sanctioned path; the
// editable preview is the point.

// -------------------------------------------------- git commit -------------

export const COMMIT_TITLE = "git: Commit";

export const COMMIT_DESCRIPTION = `**COMMITS the staged changes — this tool runs \`git commit\`, it is not a text generator.** USE THIS for every commit, on any git host. The agent drafts the subject and (optional) body; the extension shows the full message in an editable preview dialog and applies it via \`git commit -F -\` only after the user accepts. The --amend flag rewrites the most recent commit instead of creating a new one.

This tool commits ONLY what is staged in the index. There is no staging tool in this extension, so stage your target files first with \`git add <files>\` via the shell (staging is NOT a bound write — only the commit itself must go through this tool). Use git_diff target="staged" to confirm what will be committed; if nothing is staged, this tool returns an error and does NOT commit, so do NOT work around it with \`git commit -a\` via the shell.

Scope: this tool drives plain \`git\` (no provider lock-in — any git host works). The other write tools in this extension drive \`gh\` and therefore cover GitHub only.

DRAFTING IS YOUR JOB, NOT THE USER'S. Draft the subject and body yourself and call this tool; the editable dialog is where the user reviews, edits, and approves. Do NOT ask the user in chat what the message should say, and do NOT ask for approval before calling. Do NOT run \`git commit\` (or \`git commit --amend\`) through the bash/shell tool yourself; this tool is the only sanctioned path and bypassing its preview is a policy violation.`;

export const COMMIT_SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION =
  "Commit subject line (the first line). Conventional Commits style is preferred when the project uses it (e.g. feat(api): add login endpoint). The user can edit this in the review dialog before the commit is applied.";

export const COMMIT_BODY_DESCRIPTION =
  "Optional commit body. Wrapped at 72 columns by git when applied. The user can edit this in the review dialog.";

export const COMMIT_AMEND_DESCRIPTION =
  "When true, amend the most recent commit instead of creating a new one. Default false.";

The agent drafts the title and body; the extension shows them in an editable preview dialog (both in one buffer) and applies via \`gh pr create\` (when no PR exists for the branch) or \`gh pr edit\` (when one does) only after the user accepts.

export const PR_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION = `**POSTS a top-level comment on a GitHub pull request conversation** (a non-review reply, an FYI to reviewers, a status update, etc.). USE THIS for any plain PR conversation comment. This tool runs \`gh pr comment <number> --body\`; the agent drafts the body and the extension shows it in an editable preview dialog, applying it only after the user accepts.

Distinct from \`git_pr_review\`: that posts a REVIEW event (COMMENT / APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES) on the PR's review summary and updates the review state; THIS tool posts a plain comment on the PR conversation via \`gh pr comment\` without touching the review state. Reach for this when you only want to leave a note; reach for \`git_pr_review\` when you want to formally approve, request changes, or summarize a code review.

export const PR_REVIEW_DESCRIPTION = `**POSTS a PR review event on GitHub** (a review summary, a formal APPROVE, or a formal REQUEST_CHANGES). USE THIS to formally review a PR. This tool runs \`gh pr review\`; the agent drafts the review body and the extension shows it in an editable preview dialog, applying it only after the user accepts.

Distinct from \`git_pr_comment\`: that posts a plain conversation comment without touching the review state; THIS tool posts a REVIEW event via \`gh pr review\` and MAY change the PR review state. APPROVE and REQUEST_CHANGES are stateful and always open an editor for explicit confirmation even when the review gate is off — use them only when the user has agreed to the verdict. For non-review notes on the PR, reach for \`git_pr_comment\` instead.

LIMITATION: this tool posts a review SUMMARY body only. It CANNOT post inline, line-level comments on specific diff hunks (what GitHub calls a "review comment"). If the user asks for a comment on a specific file and line, say so explicitly and put the file:line reference in the summary body instead.

Scope: GitHub only — this tool drives the \`gh\` CLI. Other git providers are not covered by this extension.
